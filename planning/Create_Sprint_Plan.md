You need to make a 2 week sprint plan for Harmony for a frontend implmentation. This includes making UI mockups with Figma, frontend code, and the frontend for dev-spec-channel-visbility-toggle and dev-spec-guest-public-channel-view. 

Use the gh cli tool to post all the issues on the Harmony Project board and assign each issue to the collaborators on the project:
acabrera04
Aiden-Barrera
AvanishKulkarni
declanblanc
FardeenI

The project context is in P1_ Requirements Engineering.md.

Here are the requirements for the assignment
1. UI Mockups in Figma
Create high-fidelity mockups for each of your two chosen user stories.

Include all states of the interface: e.g., empty state, loading, error, success, etc.
Include enough detail about the intended graphical design in your Figma project to help a developer to implement the appropriate CSS and layout code. For example, if your design needs to relayout in a specific way when the window is stretched or zoomed, please annotate the design with the behavior you want to see.
Write up the rationale for major design choices (e.g., navigation flow, component reuse, accessibility).
Check in high-resolution screenshots of your mockups into your project’s GitHub repository.

2. Frontend Implementation
Implement the user stories in code using a popular frontend framework (e.g., React, Svelte).

Using your LLM, generate the front end code from your user stories, Figma mockups (with their design rationale and developer implementation guides), and development specifications.
Include responsive design for at least two screen sizes.
Ensure accessibility compliance with WCAG and alt-text for images where appropriate.
Ensure any backend functionality or data is mocked such that the frontend functionality can be demonstrated.
Important: The code for both user stories must be generated into the same frontend application. Watch out for duplicated functionality, inconsistent class names, and incomplete interfaces.

Screen record yourself testing the frontend implementation in a web browser (include appropriate voiceover narration so we can follow what you’re trying to show). It should display correctly at your two different screen sizes. Use the browser’s debugger to accurately set the screen size during testing. Resize the browser window with your mouse/finger to test for proper layout logic.
Upload the screen recording to YouTube.
Check in the frontend implementation to your GitHub repository.

When creating the sprint plan, also include any prerequeste tasks that we need to have a working frontend for building this applicatino from the ground up.
