## Workflow Orchestration
### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop 
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management
This project uses a **hybrid approach**: `tasks/todo.md` for AI context, GitHub Issues as the canonical tracker on the Harmony Project Board (course requirement).

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items (local scratch pad for AI context)
2. **Ident  ify the Issue**: If the task maps to an existing GitHub Issue, note the issue number at the top of `tasks/todo.md`
3. **Announce Start**: Post an opening comment to the issue — `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."` — describing what will be done
4. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete in `tasks/todo.md` as you go; post a comment to the issue at meaningful milestones (e.g., after a major step or when blocked)
5. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
6. **Document Results**: Add a review section to `tasks/todo.md` and post a final summary comment to the issue when complete
7. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections. Post the new lessons learned as a comment to the issue.

### Issue Comment Format
Use this structure for issue comments to keep the audit trail readable:

```
**[AI Agent — <Step>]**

<What was done or decided>

<Any blockers, decisions, or next steps>
```

Example steps: `Starting`, `In Progress`, `Blocked`, `Complete`

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
