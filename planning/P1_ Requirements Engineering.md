# Initial Value Proposition / Product Description

1. What is the big idea of the startup you have chosen? What problem is it solving? What is its solution? What makes their solution special and distinguishes it from the competition? Do not use an LLM for this part. (1-2 paragraphs)

We are creating a social chat platform, designed to be indexable by search engines. Significant information is locked behind account gates on platforms like Discord, concealing it from anonymous users. Chat platforms are also plagued with mediocre search engines, making it difficult to find relevant information. 

Our solution is to create a chat platform designed around preexisting search engines. Channels can be exposed to the internet, allowing users to browse previously concealed information from their search engine of choice. This is superior to existing competition like Glean, which is primarily for enterprise users and forces you to use a new search. It also allows for searching real-time communication, unlike Reddit’s more asynchronous forum based structure. 

2. What is/are the value proposition(s) for your product? Do not use an LLM for this part. (1-2 sentences)

The value proposition of the product lies in the ability for people to spread the knowledge they share through chats in public chat servers or DMs to other people who have niche questions on the topic or belong to niche interest groups. 

3. Ask an LLM to describe the value proposition(s) for your product (1-2 sentences). 

This platform unlocks information confined to private chat servers by allowing search engines to index specific channels. It combines the real-time engagement of chat applications with the public discoverability and archival value of forums.

This startup unlocks **"dark social"** by making private chat communities searchable, driving organic growth for creators while providing searchers with authentic, human-led answers previously hidden behind login walls. Essentially, it transforms ephemeral conversations into a permanent, indexable knowledge base that bridges the gap between real-time chat and global discovery.

4. What is the difference between the human and LLM-generated value propositions? Which one is more compelling? (3-4 sentences)

The major difference between the human and LLM-generated value propositions is that the human version uses less flattery but is direct and to the point with understanding exactly what the value in our product holds. This compared to the LLM-generated value proposition is more attention grabbing with the sentence and verbiage usage such as it including “dark social” which wasn’t mentioned in the the prompting. The LLM-generated rendition is more compelling with the verbiage used but I believe this is intentional with the model to be engaging with the material it trained upon to get the attention of people better.

# Viability Analysis: Why do people want it?

*Interview transcripts and other details can be found in "interview\_transcripts.pdf"*

### 10 Interview Questions:

1. Do you frequently use chat apps?  
2. “What digital platform do you use to ask questions?”  
3. "When was the last time you searched for a specific technical or niche problem and couldn't find the answer on Google or Reddit?"  
4. "Walk me through the steps you took to find that answer once the search engine results failed you."  
5. Do you ever try to look for information online but have to create an account to view the response?  
6. Are you a member of any online communities? If so, how did you end up finding them?  
7. Think of your favorite community. If you could read those threads without logging in or joining, would you still join? Why/Why not?  
8. "Have you ever gone back looking for something specific someone said in a group chat, days or weeks later? What happened?"  
9. "How do you currently save or bookmark useful conversations you find in chat apps?"  
10. "If you're looking for a past solution in your server, how do you usually find it?"

### Where you found your four interviewees and how you interviewed them

### Allen and Avanish’s Interviews with John and Kapila \- John and Kapila have been friends with Allen and Avanish for 4 years, and Avanish went to high school with both of them. They interviewed them both in-person and for each interview Allen and Avanish swapped who would take notes and who would conduct the interview. Allen and Avanish recorded the interview using the voice memo application on their Macs and used the generated transcript from the recordings.

Fardeen and Aiden’s Interviews with Tobi and Ian \- The first interviewee was Tobi and the second interviewee was Ian. Tobi is Fardeen’s coworker-turned-close friend since Senior Year of high school. Ian is Fardeen’s long time close friend from 6th grade in his hometown elementary school. For further context, Tobi is currently a 4th year nursing student at Ramapo College and Ian is currently a 4th year exercise science student at Rutgers University-NB. Fardeen and Aiden held the interviews utilizing transcription technology informally over Discord Call.  
Declan’s Interview’s with Nandika and Anthony \- Nandika is a classmate and friend of Declan’s who did not know the project idea prior to this interview. Declan arranged and scheduled this interview over text and met in person on campus. Anthony is a classmate and friend of Declan’s who did not know the project idea prior to this interview. Declan arranged and scheduled this interview over text and met in person on campus.

### One thing that went well and one thing that went poorly in any interview:

One thing that went poorly in some interviews was having trouble sticking to the script. This was largely due to the fact that once earlier questions had been answered, some of the later questions felt redundant or even irrelevant. For example, asking "Have you ever tried to share a solution you found in a chat group with a friend or colleague? How did you send it to them?" did not feel like it made sense to ask after the interviewee had already told us that they do not turn to chat apps for solutions. One thing that did go well was learning that people didn't tend to go to Discord when looking for solutions. Discord can be a great tool for communicating with community members to learn more about niche technical things. Anthony's experience with NixOS is a wonderful example of this. He was eventually able to find what he needed by diligently looking through documentation and public GitHub repositories, but he may have been able to learn more by joining a NixOS community and speaking with other users of that operating system. Our proposed project has the potential to bridge this gap and create a place where users can expect to not only find solutions, but ask questions as needed.

### The five most useful questions you asked:

1. "When was the last time you searched for a specific technical or niche problem and couldn't find the answer on Google or Reddit?"  
2. "Walk me through the steps you took to find that answer once the search engine results failed you."  
3. “Are you a member of any online communities? If so, how did you end up finding them?”  
4. “Think of your favorite community. If you could read those threads without logging in or joining, would you still join? Why/Why not?”  
5. “What digital platform do you use to ask questions?”

### The five most useful pieces of concrete data you collected:

1. If a user couldn’t find a result on google, they would usually turn to an AI chatbot as their second choice.  
2. Many users nowadays turn to ChatGPT or other LLMs as opposed to joining online communities.  
3. For an average college student, when searching the answer to a question, if the platform hosting the answer they’re searching for requires account registration and authentication, the student will likely feel inconvenienced and search elsewhere for their answer.  
4. In large discord servers / communities, it is common for members to “lurk”, passively reading conversation logs for updates as opposed to actively participating.  
5. In community servers, users can have a hard time searching for information in regular channels.

### Human-Written Summary:

When conducting user experience research for this assignment, my groupmates and I all decided to interview fellow college students. As a result, the collection of interview results and feedback we received is representative of the average college student persona. The questions we asked our peers were centered around the user experience of searching for answers to questions and managing useful information exchanged through chat applications. We found that the average college student of today’s day and age has a high ease of access to solutions to their questions through the benefit of the internet. We found that the average college student’s first solution to searching for answers to a question is utilizing the popular search engine Google. The average college student finds success in their Google searches a majority of the time, and experiences difficulty finding direct answers to their questions almost exclusively when their questions are niche or highly nuanced. Oftentimes, the average college student’s failover mechanism when dissatisfied with the answers their search results provide is to plug the same question into an LLM-integrated application like ChatGPT or Gemini. Interviewees also note that, as of lately, sometimes, their first route of action when searching for the solution to a problem they have is by consulting their favorite LLM-integrated application. Interviewees note that when searching the answer to a question, if the platform hosting the answer they’re searching for requires account registration and authentication, they feel inconvenienced and will search elsewhere for their answer. 

With regards to chat applications, every interviewee noted that they use Discord. Many interviewees mentioned that their behavior in large Discord servers is passive, reading through updates and mentions, rather than actively participating in conversation. Interviewees note that the search functionality in Discord is “usually good enough” when they wish to refer back to some information exchanged in a previous conversation, so long as they remember key phrases, and doing so is easier in public forums / servers than in private conversations. Furthermore, the average college student does not usually bookmark / explicitly save conversation points for later, noting that server mods typically pin important information, saving them the need to do so. The key takeaways from the interviewees for our focus area is that the average college student does not frequently turn to online forums as their first source when searching for solutions to problems and that the most disqualifying factor for a college student’s search tool of choice is inconvenience of use. This could mean that the value of the solution our product aims to introduce may not be great enough for the average college student to utilize our product over something like an LLM-integrated application as a first option for their search experience.

### AI-Written Summary:

The user research for Harmony involved informal Discord interviews with diverse peers—including nursing and exercise science students (Tobi and Ian), alongside previous participants (Nandika, Anthony, John, Kapila). These conversations strongly validate the friction caused by "walled garden" communities and the limitations of current search tools. Multiple participants confirmed they immediately abandon websites that require a login or subscription to view answers, preferring to find similar information elsewhere. While Google and AI are primary first steps , users noted that AI often fails or "hallucinates" on highly niche technical topics, forcing them to rely on GitHub, YouTube, or documentation. Furthermore, internal search limitations were highlighted as a pain point; John noted that searching general text channels in Discord is difficult compared to forums , and Kapila described Discord’s search as "slow". The interview process also highlighted the importance of agile questioning; researchers learned to adapt when a participant's habits didn't match the script, such as pivoting a rigid question about "server search history" into a broader inquiry about general information retrieval when they realized the user didn't even save past chats.

However, the viability of a "public by default" platform faces challenges regarding user retention and community migration. John explicitly stated he would probably not join a community if he could read threads without logging in, as his primary goal is usually just finding an answer. This consumption-focused behavior is reinforced by Anthony and Nandika, who use public servers mostly for updates or resources rather than active socializing. Conversely, Kapila stated she would still join for exclusive "perks" beyond just information access. Crucially, a successful exchange with Tobi revealed a strong driver for platform adoption: creator loyalty. Tobi noted that if a favored creator moved to a new platform, he would "most definitely" support them and create an account, provided the signup was free. This suggests that while Harmony successfully addresses the technical information retrieval problem, its go-to-market strategy should rely heavily on community leaders migrating their dedicated followings, offering distinct membership incentives to maintain the engagement it aims to host.

# User Stories

## Original 10 User Stories

Here are 10 user stories based on the project description and user interviews, designed for a platform that bridges real-time chat with search engine discoverability.

### 1\. The "Login Wall" Removal

**As a** Guest User (Searcher), **I want** to view the full contents of a public channel via a direct URL without being prompted to log in, **so that** I can get the answer to my specific question immediately without the friction of creating an account I might only use once.

* **What this is really about:** This addresses the primary pain point cited by interviewees Nandika and Anthony, who immediately abandon sites that force a login. It is the core "value add" of the product—reducing friction for information retrieval.  
* **Estimation:** Large  
* **Sprint Feasibility:** Yes. In a 2-week sprint, this involves creating a read-only view of the chat interface and adjusting API permissions to allow unauthenticated GET requests for public channels.

### 2\. The "Public" Toggle

**As a** Community Administrator, **I want** to toggle specific channels as "Public/Indexable" or "Private," **so that** I can control which parts of my community are exposed to the open web while keeping sensitive social conversations private.

* **What this is really about:** This enables the "hybrid" nature of the platform described in `PROJECT.md`. It allows the community to serve both as a knowledge base (Public) and a social hangout (Private), giving admins control over privacy.  
* **Estimation:** Small  
* **Sprint Feasibility:** Yes. This requires a database schema update (boolean flag), a UI toggle in settings, and backend logic to check this flag before serving content to guests.

### 3\. SEO Metadata Automation

**As a** Content Creator, **I want** public threads to automatically generate HTML meta tags (Title, Description) based on the conversation content, **so that** my community appears with relevant previews in Google search results, driving organic growth.

* **What this is really about:** This fulfills the project goal of "driving organic growth for creators." Without this, the "indexable" feature is useless because search engines won't rank the content effectively.  
* **Estimation:** Medium  
* **Sprint Feasibility:** Yes. This involves server-side rendering (SSR) or dynamic meta-tag generation based on the first few messages of a thread or channel topic.

### 4\. Threaded Conversation View

**As a** Technical User, **I want** to reply to specific messages in a "thread" that groups the question and answer together, **so that** future readers can follow the solution without wading through unrelated chatter in the main channel.

* **What this is really about:** This addresses John Mohring’s feedback that Discord’s general chat is hard to search, while "forum channels" are better for finding answers. It structures data for better readability and archiving.  
* **Estimation:** Xtra-Large  
* **Sprint Feasibility:** Yes, but likely occupies the majority of the sprint. It requires database relationship handling (parent-child messages) and significant UI work for the threaded view.

### 5\. Code Syntax Highlighting

**As a** Developer (Nandika/Anthony), **I want** to post code snippets that are automatically syntax-highlighted, **so that** the code is readable and easy to copy for users finding my solution via search.

* **What this is really about:** The interviews heavily skew towards technical users (CS students, NixOS users). To compete with StackOverflow or GitHub as a knowledge source, code readability is a non-negotiable requirement.  
* **Estimation:** Medium  
* **Sprint Feasibility:** Yes. This involves integrating a library (like Prism.js or highlight.js) into the message renderer and supporting Markdown input.

### 6\. Message Permalinks

**As a** User, **I want** to generate a direct, shareable link to a specific message or thread, **so that** I can send a specific solution to a friend or save it for later reference.

* **What this is really about:** This supports the "sharing" aspect of the social platform and aids in SEO by creating distinct entry points for specific topics, rather than just linking to a generic channel feed.  
* **Estimation:** Small  
* **Sprint Feasibility:** Yes. Requires a URL routing strategy (e.g., `/channel/123/message/456`) and a UI action to copy the link.

### 7\. Internal Keyword Search

**As a** Community Member, **I want** to search for past messages using specific keywords within a channel, **so that** I can retrieve information I vaguely remember seeing months ago.

* **What this is really about:** Validating Anthony and Kapila’s use cases. Even with Google indexing, internal users need a quick way to recall info ("I have a good memory so I know keywords"). It needs to be faster than Discord’s "slow" search.  
* **Estimation:** Medium  
* **Sprint Feasibility:** Yes. Can be implemented with basic SQL `LIKE` queries initially, or a text-search engine (like ElasticSearch/Algolia) integration if the backend is ready.

### 8\. Pinned Resources

**As a** Frequent User, **I want** to view a list of "Pinned" messages in a channel, **so that** I can quickly access important documentation or recurring resources without searching.

* **What this is really about:** Kapila explicitly mentioned using pins on Discord as her primary bookmarking tool. This is essential for the "knowledge base" aspect of the platform.  
* **Estimation:** Small  
* **Sprint Feasibility:** Yes. A simple flag on messages and a side-panel query to list them.

### 9\. The "Join for Perks" Flow

**As a** Guest Viewer, **I want** to see a clear call-to-action to "Join" that highlights member benefits (e.g., posting, saving, exclusive channels), **so that** I understand why I should convert from a passive reader to an active member.

* **What this is really about:** Conversion. Kapila noted she would join a community even if she could read it for free, *if* there were perks. This story bridges the gap between the "public search engine" utility and the "social platform" business model.  
* **Estimation:** Medium  
* **Sprint Feasibility:** Yes. Requires UI design for the unauthenticated view (banner/button) and integration with the sign-up flow.

### 10\. Community Categorization/Tags

**As a** User with Niche Interests (e.g., F1, NixOS), **I want** to see tags or categories for communities (e.g., "Tech," "Racing," "Universities"), **so that** I can browse and discover other relevant groups that match my interests.

* **What this is really about:** Discovery. Nandika and Anthony have specific niche interests. This feature helps categorize the "dark social" content so it's browseable, not just searchable via specific queries.  
* **Estimation:** Small  
* **Sprint Feasibility:** Yes. Adding a `category` or `tags` field to the Community model and a filterable list view on the homepage

## Eliminated User Stories

The following 5 user stories have been removed from the priority backlog based on the INVEST evaluation. While valuable, they are either too large, lower priority for the initial MVP, or secondary to the core "search-indexable" value proposition.

### 1\. Code Syntax Highlighting

* **Reason for Drop:** While essential for the developer demographic, this is a "nice-to-have" rendering feature rather than a core architectural component. The platform can technically function and be indexed without it. It can be added in a later sprint once the core content delivery pipeline is stable. It is a feature enhancement, not a foundational requirement for the "Searchable Chat" MVP.

### 2\. Pinned Resources

* **Reason for Drop:** This is a standard chat feature (parity with Discord/Slack) but does not directly contribute to the *unique* value proposition of "public searchability." External users finding content via Google will land on the specific message/thread they searched for, reducing the immediate necessity of a "Pin" board for discovery. It is a quality-of-life improvement for retention, not acquisition.

### 3\. Community Categorization/Tags

* **Reason for Drop:** Discovery via internal browsing (tags/categories) is secondary to the primary discovery mechanism: external search engines. Until the platform has a critical mass of communities, a directory/categorization system provides little value. Users are expected to arrive via direct search hits, not by browsing a homepage directory.

### 4\. Internal Keyword Search

* **Reason for Drop:** The project's unique selling point is *external* indexability (Google/Bing). Implementing a robust *internal* search engine is complex and resource-intensive. For an MVP, we can rely on users using "site:ourplatform.com \[query\]" on Google to find content, or simple browser-based "Find in Page" for shorter histories. This de-risks the sprint by deferring complex backend search infrastructure.

### 5\. Threaded Conversation View

* **Reason for Drop:** This story was rated "Xtra-Large" and violates the "Small" principle of INVEST. It represents a significant architectural complexity (changing the fundamental message model) that poses a high risk to sprint completion. It should be broken down into multiple smaller stories (e.g., "Reply Data Model," "UI nesting," "Collapse logic") and tackled only after the linear chat experience is perfected.

## Top Five User Stories & Sprint Assignments

# Product Backlog & Sprint Schedule

This document outlines the roadmap for the next 10 weeks, enabling the "Search-Indexable Chat Platform" MVP. The stories are ordered to manage dependencies (Security \-\> Core Feature \-\> Architecture \-\> Growth \-\> Conversion).

### Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2): The "Public" Toggle

**User Story:** As a Community Administrator, I want to toggle specific channels as "Public/Indexable" or "Private," so that I can control which parts of my community are exposed to the open web while keeping sensitive social conversations private.

**Why this is the right story:** Security and privacy must be established *before* we open any doors. Building the mechanism to expose content (removing the login wall) without first having the database controls to flag *what* should be exposed is reckless. By implementing the backend schema changes and admin controls first, we ensure that when we flip the switch on public access in the next sprint, no private communities are accidentally leaked. This lays the foundational data structure for the hybrid public/private model.

### Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4): The "Login Wall" Removal

**User Story:** As a Guest User (Searcher), I want to view the full contents of a public channel via a direct URL without being prompted to log in, so that I can get the answer to my specific question immediately without the friction of creating an account I might only use once.

**Why this is the right story:** This is the "Large" story that delivers the core value proposition of the product. With the privacy toggles from Sprint 1 in place, we can now safely implement the unauthenticated read-only view. Tackling this high-effort story early reduces project risk, as it forces us to solve the technical challenges of serving chat content to non-logged-in users (API permission adjustments, UI state for guests) immediately. Without this, the platform is just a standard, walled-garden chat app.

### Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6): Message Permalinks

**User Story:** As a User, I want to generate a direct, shareable link to a specific message or thread, so that I can send a specific solution to a friend or save it for later reference.

**Why this is the right story:** Now that public access exists, we need granular entry points. Currently, a guest lands on the main channel feed. To effectively compete with forums (and for the upcoming SEO sprint), we need the ability to link directly to a specific answer or conversation context. This architectural change (stable routing for messages) provides the specific "landing targets" for search engines and social sharing, improving the UX for users who are sharing solutions found in Sprint 2\.

### Sprint 4 (Weeks 7-8): SEO Metadata Automation

**User Story:** As a Content Creator, I want public threads to automatically generate HTML meta tags (Title, Description) based on the conversation content, so that my community appears with relevant previews in Google search results, driving organic growth.

**Why this is the right story:** We have the content exposed (Sprint 2\) and specific URLs to point to (Sprint 3). Now we need to make them discoverable. Simply having a public page isn't enough; search engines need semantic data to rank it. This sprint activates the "growth engine" of the platform. Doing this earlier would have been premature (as the pages didn't exist), but doing it later would delay the organic traffic feedback loop that is critical for testing the product's market fit.

### Sprint 5 (Weeks 9-10): The "Join for Perks" Flow

**User Story:** As a Guest Viewer, I want to see a clear call-to-action to "Join" that highlights member benefits (e.g., posting, saving, exclusive channels), so that I understand why I should convert from a passive reader to an active member.

**Why this is the right story:** At this stage, the platform is generating traffic via search (Sprint 4\) and delivering value to guests (Sprint 2). The final step in this MVP cycle is capturing that value. We focus on conversion *last* because you cannot convert users who aren't there yet. This sprint implements the "upsell" logic—turning the passive traffic generated by the previous sprints into active, registered users who contribute content, completing the ecosystem's lifecycle.
