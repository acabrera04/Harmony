# Agent Instructions for Harmony

This file provides context and guidelines for AI coding agents (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) working on the Harmony project.

## Harmony is a **search engine indexable chat application** @README.md .

## Agent Workflow Guidelines
Always write design rationale comments if intentions are not immediately obvious and ensure these comments are up to date.
Before starting any development task, read and follow the rules in @WORKFLOW.md 
It defines workflow orchestration, task management, and core principles all agents must follow.

Always check for lint or build errors before committing code.

### Specs/Docs
- No build/test commands for specifications
- Jest/Playwright/Lighthouse referenced in specs are design intent for future implementation
- Specs and architecture documents are located in @docs/

## Key repository conventions
- Dev specs use a strict numbered structure (`1`–`13`; SEO spec also has `14. Acceptance Criteria`).
- Preserve spec labeling prefixes exactly: `M#` (modules), `CL-C#`/`CL-D#`/`CL-E#`/`CL-I#` (classes/DTOs/entities/interfaces), `D#`/`T#`/`F#`/`S#`/`B#` (schemas/tech/flows/states).
- Keep **Section 3 (Class Diagram)** and **Section 4 (List of Classes)** synchronized whenever classes are added/renamed.
- Preserve canonical visibility enum values exactly: `PUBLIC_INDEXABLE`, `PUBLIC_NO_INDEX`, `PRIVATE`.

- Always verify tests are running successfully in both the backend and the frontend before pushing changes

### Role-Specific Behaviors

#### PR Reviews 
IF your current task involves conducting a code review or reviewing a Pull Request, THEN you MUST read and strictly adhere to the guidelines defined in `@.github/PR_REVIEW.md`. Do not begin the review until you have parsed this file.
