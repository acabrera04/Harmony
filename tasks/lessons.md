**Date:** 2026-03-31  
**Caught by:** [AI Agent: Claude]  
**Related Issue:** N/A  
**Mistake / Situation:** The E2E suite mixed selector expectations based on route slugs with UI labels rendered from channel display names, and one startup preflight used a one-shot auth check while the rest of setup retried.  
**Rule / Fix:** E2E assertions must target the exact accessibility text the UI renders, not adjacent seed identifiers, and all backend readiness checks should share the same retry semantics so cold-start timing does not create false failures.

**Date:** 2026-03-31  
**Caught by:** [AI Agent: Claude]  
**Related Issue:** N/A  
**Mistake / Situation:** E2E preflight initially verified seeded content but skipped critical auth assumptions, and the shared E2E helper encoded environment defaults too implicitly.  
**Rule / Fix:** E2E preconditions must verify every special-case fixture the suite depends on, including auth overrides, and shared test helpers should avoid hidden runtime defaults like hardcoded `NODE_ENV`.

**Date:** 2026-03-31  
**Caught by:** [AI Agent: Claude]  
**Related Issue:** N/A  
**Mistake / Situation:** The first true-E2E pass duplicated stack constants across TS and Node launcher files and allowed local server reuse, which made reruns stateful and brittle.  
**Rule / Fix:** For stateful E2E stacks, keep shared ports/URLs/test credentials in one cross-runtime JS module and force the backend launcher to restart/reset locally unless there is an explicit reason to preserve state.
