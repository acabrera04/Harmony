# Deployment Sprint Plan — April 8–19, 2026

## Context
Harmony is a search-engine-indexable chat application with a Next.js frontend and an Express + tRPC backend backed by PostgreSQL and Redis. Sprint 4 adapts the P6 deployment assignment to a **Vercel + Railway** production stack:

- **Frontend hosting:** Vercel
- **Backend hosting:** Railway
- **Database:** Railway Postgres
- **Cache / event bus:** Railway Redis
- **Public deployment goal:** keep the app deployed through instructor review
- **Scaling goal:** support **2 or more backend API replicas** on Railway while keeping background event processing correct

This sprint must cover the substance of **P6 Deployment** while ignoring the AWS-only platform choice. The plan therefore replaces:

- AWS Lambda/API Gateway with Railway backend services
- AWS Amplify with Vercel frontend hosting
- AWS CD workflows with Vercel/Railway CD workflows

Integration testing for this sprint uses a dual-target model: `local` for deterministic development verification and `cloud` for validation of the real deployed multi-replica system.

The assignment requirements we still must satisfy are:

1. Publicly deploy frontend and backend
2. Automate deployment from GitHub
3. Add integration test specifications and implementation
4. Run integration tests locally and in the cloud
5. Add GitHub Actions for integration tests
6. Adopt GitHub hygiene and branch protection
7. Update README with user-facing and deployer-facing instructions
8. Produce the final submission artifacts, links, logs, and reflection

**Assignment:** P6: Deployment  
**Due:** Sunday, April 19, 2026, 11:59 PM AOE

## Team
5 developers: acabrera04, Aiden-Barrera, AvanishKulkarni, declanblanc, FardeenI

## Target Architecture

### Public Services
- `frontend` on Vercel
- `backend-api` on Railway with **2+ replicas**

### Internal / Stateful Services
- `backend-worker` on Railway with **1 replica only**
- `postgres` on Railway
- `redis` on Railway

### Domain Layout
- `https://<frontend-domain>` -> Vercel
- `https://api.<frontend-domain>` -> Railway `backend-api`

### Multi-Backend Railway Rules
To safely support 2+ backend replicas, the sprint must remove or isolate process-local production state:

- Public/auth rate limiting must use **Redis-backed shared storage**
- File uploads must use **shared object storage**, not local disk
- Background subscribers / cache invalidation / sitemap updates must run in a **singleton worker**
- API replicas must be stateless apart from live SSE client connections
- Deployment verification must prove that 2+ API replicas behave correctly behind Railway load balancing

### Explicit Production Decisions
- **SEO ownership:** the **Vercel frontend apex domain** is the canonical public SEO surface. `robots.txt`, sitemap/index entrypoints, canonical URLs, and `metadataBase` must resolve on the frontend domain, not the API subdomain.
- **Attachment storage target:** production uploads use **Cloudflare R2 via an S3-compatible provider**. Local filesystem storage remains development-only.
- **Deploy authority:** **GitHub Actions** is the single source of truth for production deploys. Provider-native Git auto-deploys may be used for previews, but production promotion must be driven by the GitHub workflows in this sprint.

- Confirm and document the required changes for:
  - in-memory rate limiting
  - local filesystem attachment storage
  - duplicate startup subscribers / background jobs
  - SSE behavior behind load balancing
  - proxy/IP handling
- Produce a concrete "replica-safe backend" checklist for implementation

- Assignee: **declanblanc**
- Backup owner: **acabrera04**
- Due: April 9
- Blocked by: #1
- Unblocks: #3, #4, #5, #14

**3. Shared Rate Limiting + Proxy-Aware Networking**
- Replace process-local rate limiting with shared Redis-backed limiting
- Replace or unify **both** current implementations:
  - auth endpoint limiting using `express-rate-limit`
  - public-route token bucket limiting
- Ensure auth and public API rate limits remain correct across 2+ replicas
- Configure Express proxy awareness so client IP handling works correctly behind Railway
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Public and auth rate limits are shared across replicas
  - No process-local auth or public-route limit counters remain in production code paths
  - Rate limit behavior is covered by tests or verification notes
- Assignee: **Aiden-Barrera**
- Due: April 11
- Blocked by: #2
- Unblocks: #14

**4. Production Attachment Storage Provider**
- Implement a production storage provider backed by **Cloudflare R2 via an S3-compatible interface**
- Keep local storage available for development only
- Add env-driven provider selection and document required secrets
- Ensure uploaded files remain accessible regardless of which API replica serves subsequent requests
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Production does not rely on local filesystem attachment serving
  - The chosen production provider is Cloudflare R2, documented as such in code and setup docs
  - README and env matrix document storage setup
  - Attachment flow works end-to-end in deployed environment
- Assignee: **AvanishKulkarni**
- Due: April 11
- Blocked by: #2
- Unblocks: #14, #15

**5. Split `backend-api` and Singleton `backend-worker`**
- Move background-only startup behavior into a dedicated worker process
- Ensure duplicated subscribers / cache invalidation / sitemap upkeep do not run on every API replica
- Keep API replicas focused on HTTP/tRPC/SSE request handling
- Add lightweight replica observability for validation:
  - instance identity in structured logs
  - instance/replica identity on health output and/or response headers
- Add startup commands for both Railway backend services
- Acceptance criteria:
  - `backend-api` can run with 2+ replicas without duplicate singleton background side effects
  - `backend-worker` runs with 1 replica and owns singleton event-driven tasks
  - Replica identity is externally observable enough to prove load balancing across 2+ API replicas
  - Service responsibilities are documented

- Blocked by: #2
- Unblocks: #7, #11, #14

### Phase 2: Frontend and Integration Foundations — April 9–13

**6. Frontend Production Configuration for Vercel**
- Add production-safe frontend configuration:
  - absolute canonical URLs
  - `metadataBase`
  - `robots.txt` on the frontend apex domain
  - sitemap support on the frontend apex domain
  - production API base URL handling
- Make the SEO ownership boundary explicit:
  - frontend apex domain owns the canonical public SEO artifacts: canonical URLs, `metadataBase`, `robots.txt`, sitemap entrypoints, and any sitemap index exposed to crawlers
  - backend SEO routes may continue to generate sitemap/XML data as an internal or transitional source, but they are not the canonical crawler-facing host in production
  - no SEO artifact should require crawlers to use the API subdomain as the primary source of truth
- Ensure frontend still supports localhost development cleanly
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Public pages generate correct production metadata
  - Canonical host ownership is explicit and consistent across frontend and backend docs/code
  - Frontend can target local and cloud backends without code edits
  - SEO-critical pages render correctly on the public domain

  - Spec is stored under `docs/test-specs/`
- Assignee: **FardeenI**
- Due: April 11
- Blocked by: #1
- Unblocks: #9, #10, #15

**9. Integration Test Implementation + Environment Matrix**
- Implement the integration tests from the spec
- Support two execution targets:
  - `local`: starts local frontend/backend dependencies and runs against localhost
  - `cloud`: runs against already-deployed frontend/backend URLs without starting local app servers
- Add environment selection via explicit env vars or script arguments
- Document which tests are:
  - portable across both targets
  - local-only because they depend on reset/seed control
  - cloud-only because they validate deployed behavior

## Notes

- We are intentionally satisfying the **intent** of P6 using Vercel + Railway rather than AWS.
- The backend **must not** be considered successfully deployed until it has been verified with **2 or more Railway API replicas**.
- `backend-worker` is a deliberate singleton to prevent duplicate background event processing.
- Any production reliance on local filesystem storage or in-memory shared state is a sprint blocker.
- All work should proceed on feature branches with PR review; no direct pushes to `main`.
